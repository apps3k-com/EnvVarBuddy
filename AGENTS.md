# AGENTS.md — CodingBuddy

Native macOS app (SwiftUI) for managing environment variables in zsh dotfiles.
Deep documentation lives in the [wiki](https://github.com/apps3k-com/CodingBuddy/wiki) — this file stays slim.

## Iron rules

### Native Swift only — no exceptions

- Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit and Apple system frameworks (Foundation, LocalAuthentication, …) only.
- NO third-party dependencies — no SPM packages, no CocoaPods, no vendored binaries — unless the maintainer explicitly approves one in writing.
- No embedded scripts or runtimes (Node, Python, shell wrappers) as a substitute for native code.

### Dotfile safety (core invariant)

- Editable lines must round-trip byte-for-byte: `ParsedAssignment.rendered == sourceLine`.
- Anything ambiguous (command substitution, multi-assignments, unclosed quotes, trailing code) is read-only and is never rewritten from parts.
- Every write: backup first, then atomic, symlink-safe, permission-preserving.
- The writer re-validates the target line against the on-disk state (`sourceLine`) before mutating — never write blindly by line index.

### Tests

- Swift Testing (`import Testing`); no new XCTest code.
- Tests NEVER touch real dotfiles or `$HOME` — temp directories only (the store's base directory is injectable).
- Parser/writer changes without new or adjusted tests do not get merged.

### Localization

- Source language is English. Every user-facing string goes through the String Catalog (`Localizable.xcstrings`) and ships with a German translation.
- No hard-coded user-facing strings outside the catalog.

### Workflow

- Feature branches off `main`; Conventional Commits (enforced by hooks/CI); squash-merge PRs.
- Every new feature sits behind a flag in `CodingBuddy/Services/FeatureFlags.swift` and is documented in `docs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`.
- User-visible changes update the wiki sources under `docs/wiki/` (EN + DE) in the same PR.

### Project management (GitHub Projects) — source of truth

- All work is tracked as **GitHub issues** in the org Project (Issues + native sub-issues).
- No work without an issue: every change starts from (or first creates) a GitHub issue.
  New ideas, findings and bugs become backlog issues instead of getting lost.
- **The PR links its issue(s) with a closing keyword** — `Closes #12` (or
  `Closes #12, #13`) in the PR body; GitHub closes the issue on merge and the Project's
  built-in workflow moves its status. A commit may add `(#12)`; release-please commits
  (`chore(main): release …`) are exempt.
- Keep the Project **Status** current: `Backlog` → `In Progress` (branch started) →
  `In Review` (PR open) → `Done` (merged/verified). Reopen the issue for bounce-backs.
- After opening a PR, set up a monitor and wait for the automated reviews (CodeRabbit,
  cubic). Handle **every finding individually**: verify it, then either fix it or reject
  it with a reasoned reply **in the review thread** — the reviewers learn from replies.
  A PR may only be merged once CI is green and every finding is fixed or answered.
- Memorable learnings from development, research and review feedback are stored via the
  **apps3k-memory MCP** (`memory_store`, tagged `codingbuddy`): gotchas, decisions,
  research findings, recurring review feedback — not routine facts the repo records anyway.

## Build & test

```bash
xcodebuild -project CodingBuddy.xcodeproj -scheme CodingBuddy build
xcodebuild test -project CodingBuddy.xcodeproj -scheme CodingBuddy \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:CodingBuddyTests
./scripts/setup.sh   # once per clone: activates the git hooks
```

## Project conventions

- Xcode synchronized folders: create new files in the matching folder (`Models/`, `Services/`, `Stores/`, `Views/`) — no pbxproj editing needed.
- `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`: mark pure logic types explicitly `nonisolated`.
- The app is deliberately NOT sandboxed (it needs dotfile access). Do not add entitlements or settings that assume a sandbox.
- UI follows macOS conventions: checkboxes over switches, `Window` (single instance) over `WindowGroup`, native `Table`/`NavigationSplitView`.


<!-- BEGIN GENERATED APPS3K MEMORY CONTRACT -->
## apps3k memory contract

Project scope: `codingbuddy` (apps3k-com/CodingBuddy).

1. Before material work, call canonical apps3k-memory through Obot with the task context. Search local then shared: project memories first, then shared memories only when local evidence is insufficient.
2. Store only durable, verified knowledge in en prose. Preserve project names, German domain terms, commands, IDs, domains, and source references verbatim.
3. Every stored memory requires verified-subject-verb-claim, project-or-shared-scope, source-reference, why-it-matters; do not store status updates, transcript fragments, or a paraphrase of an existing memory.
4. Use exactly one shared memory for cross-project facts; do not copy it into every project scope.
5. Finish every session with either a durable store or a documented no_store outcome. A memory-service failure is recorded as memory_unavailable and never silently counted as compliance.

The generated hook manifest is report-only. Do not turn it into a blocking runtime hook until the memory service records authenticated session context.
